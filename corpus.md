# Corpus analysis

Following the lead of Grimm & McNally (2015), we want to take a quantitative look at the empirical distribution of Spanish nominalized infinitives. In the following, we summarize our approach

### Collection
* **which corpus?**
* Extract utterances with endings *-ir*, *-ar*, or *er*
* Context window of 200 words


### Cleaning

* Exclude false infinitives **is there a syntactic criterion we could use for filtering? Otherwise use RAE or similar as criterion for lexicalization**

### Categorization
